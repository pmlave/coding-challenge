# Weave Frontend Coding Challenge

## Setup

Get all of the dependencies by running:
```
npm i
```
That will read from the package.json and give you everything you need to get going.

To get the server started, run:
```
npm start
```

## Technology Used
- [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org) - For a little help building web components.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - For global state management.
- [pwa-helpers](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-helpers) - For connecting redux to our component and a basic routing strategy. 

## Objective

First you will need to create a page to show available drivers and orders placed in the system in a clean and elegant way. The data has been stubbed out in Redux. Then you will need a way to assign orders to drivers who are available using Redux actions.

The things we are looking for:
- Clean and elegant design
- Usage of web components
- Usage of Redux actions and reducers

## Considerations
- Google is your friend. We use Google as well. If you don't know the answer to something, feel free to do that. Part of the job is knowing how to find answers.
- We make heavy use to ES6 style coding for Javascript. If you haven't seen this before, [check this page out for a walkthrough](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/). We are coding for/in the future, basically.
- [No jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com), [please](http://vanilla-js.com)!
